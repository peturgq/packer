* Issues
** digitalocean's provisioners are running as root, but vmware as bhyde
** less should be done in anaconda and more in provisioners
** time synch is needed
* VMWARE issues
** sometimes the mac machine locks up and I have to powercycle!
** install-emacs24 doesn't work as a provisioner
   the resulting executable is corrupted.  works find run later?
** sometimes I can't shutdown a guest, i have to power it down.
** deleting VM is wonky, the pattern doesn't seem dependable.
* CCL
** ccl.tgz is full of stuff we don't use, so could be pruned

* Emacs
** encrypted files are useless due to sensitive changes to gpg

This directory, and in particular it's makefile, can create a
virtual machine that runs on VMware Fusion (for the mac) with
Centos[1] in that VM.  It uses packer[2] to that.

Prior to running the makefile you'll need to have:
- installed packer
- installed VMware Fusion
- and downloaded the CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso for Centos[3]

Put CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso into iso/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso.

You may wish to tinker with
- pack.json+ -- which tells packer what to do.
- http_directory/anaconda-ks.cfg which tells CentOS's kickstarter[4] how to
  setup the machine.
- change the centos mirror used in both those

At that point just do
$ make
and cross your fingers.
